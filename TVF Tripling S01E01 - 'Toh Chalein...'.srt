1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,168
What comes to your mind
when you hear the words

2
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:23,287
Road Trip?

3
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:25,652
Hangover

4
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:27,471
Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara

5
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:30,341
Dil Chahta Hai

6
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:32,701
Basically friends...

7
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:34,547
Rocking it

8
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:36,562
Baba, what are you doing?

9
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:37,587
Bastard

10
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:39,530
But would you ever
consider doing

11
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:42,134
A road trip with your siblings?

12
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,054
Road Trip with brother and sister?

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,804
It could be fun, you know.

14
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:54,551
Baba, mind your language!

15
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:59,661
Ah! You're choking me!

16
00:01:00,063 --> 00:01:01,662
Let go my hair, you ass.

17
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:13,643
Baba, I was worried about you.

18
00:01:15,223 --> 00:01:16,897
Baba, you're an animal!

19
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,591
You have betrayed me!

20
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:24,074
Hey, that's your car!

21
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:30,598
What the fuck!

22
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:32,689
What stupidity is this?

23
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:35,022
Did Chanchal take the car?

24
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:36,999
I doubted her ever since my childhood.

25
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:37,562
Hey!

26
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:40,112
You're the one who looks like a thief.

27
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,355
I was watching your pansy fight

28
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,792
RV isn't there too!

29
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:50,110
Oh, shit!

30
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,260
Oh, fuck!

31
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,959
Baba, I'm so sorry.

32
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:47,565
Shut it down and raise the
volume of this match!

33
00:02:57,529 --> 00:03:00,161
Chitvan...

34
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,488
Extremely talented and I
really love your music

35
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,561
But these guys clearly don't

36
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:17,568
Everyone will dance once
the match gets over.

37
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:19,862
Now lower the volume
and play the pen-drive

38
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:21,632
Take a break.

39
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:40,531
Baba?

40
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,062
Hey, Chitvan. You're here

41
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:44,130
Baba, this is such a surprise...

42
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:46,230
Watch it, man. You're
peeing on my shoe.

43
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,630
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I got excited.

44
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:50,243
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:51,097
Taking a piss.

46
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,265
I mean, here, in the club.

47
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:54,531
I came to meet you.

48
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:58,550
Bombay? What are you
doing in India?

49
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,320
I sent you an e-mail.

50
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:03,630
Was waiting at the airport since 5.
Finally, decided to come by myself.

51
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,731
Baba...

52
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:08,193
I check emails after 11:45 a.m.
on Mondays

53
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:22,819
Divorce?

54
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:26,235
When did you get  married?

55
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:28,608
What drugs are you on?

56
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:32,060
Weren't you living with that
foreigner boss of yours?

57
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:32,933
Yes.

58
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,216
Whom did you marry?

59
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,472
Same woman.

60
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:38,203
But wasn't she quite elder to you?

61
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:39,801
So?

62
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:43,588
When did you marry?

63
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,882
6 months back.

64
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:48,188
You didn't even invite me!

65
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:49,795
Are you a fool?

66
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:51,820
We talked on the phone.
You congratulated me.

67
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:53,280
We had a Skype chat.

68
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:54,954
Oh, really?

69
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:57,112
What the fuck is wrong with you?

70
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:04,650
Are you done?
Because I got done.

71
00:05:04,658 --> 00:05:07,769
I'm just giving
you some company.

72
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,980
Baba, it's so nice to see you!

73
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:13,496
What are you doing?
Wash your hands.

74
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:21,037
He's told me this much, dad.

75
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:23,338
I'll call you once I
know the details.

76
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:24,346
Yeah, alright

77
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:25,894
Okay. Bye.

78
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:35,101
Don't spill any of this to the parents.

79
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,732
Sure.

80
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:46,620
Compatibility is...

81
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:49,211
A bitch.

82
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:55,026
Love and stuff is still simple

83
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:57,479
But tuning.

84
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,201
That's important.

85
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:02,954
Because if you want two
different things in life,

86
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,731
It fucking never works.

87
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:10,669
They tend to dominate

88
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,121
Yeah, man.

89
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:14,328
Take it to their ego

90
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,891
Handcuffs

91
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:24,748
Using hunters and all

92
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:29,172
Ike the entire womanhood is taking revenge
for 50 shades of Grey.

93
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,907
What are you saying?

94
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,637
You were telling about

95
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:39,145
Domination and sexually powerful position

96
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:40,962
I suggest that from the very beginning,

97
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:45,211
Show her who's boss in bed.
Shut her up right there.

98
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:48,088
I'm not talking about my sex life.
It's general compatibility.

99
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,595
You're so dumb!

100
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,246
Oh!

101
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,961
Your sex life was sorted?

102
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:56,849
My sex life?

103
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,318
I'm your elder brother, you fool.
She's your in-law.

104
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:02,342
Was.

105
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:05,219
Was my in-law.

106
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,751
I've accepted it. You should, too.

107
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:10,693
Baba,

108
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:12,607
Drink.

109
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:16,642
Be right back.

110
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:20,487
Compatibility...

111
00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:22,690
is a bitch.

112
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,214
Love and all gets managed.

113
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:27,960
But tuning.

114
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:29,800
That's vital.

115
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:33,721
Then if you want two
different things in life

116
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:36,638
Compatibility

117
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:39,129
It all comes down to that.

118
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:52,977
What do you mean?

119
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:55,335
Where should I take him
in this condition?

120
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:58,556
He's your brother,
not some stray dog, bro.

121
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,462
He came to you
directly from America.

122
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:01,867
What are you talking about?

123
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:04,676
Obviously, you have
to take him with you.

124
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,160
Yeah, that was insensitive of me, no?

125
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,029
But I'm not habitual
of having him around

126
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:12,989
Yeah, but

127
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:14,981
Family stands by you in times of crisis.

128
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,178
Where are we?

129
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,708
About to reach Navsari.

130
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:50,743
Gujarat border, baba.

131
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,959
If you need any booze then let's
pick it up. You won't find it ahead.

132
00:08:54,943 --> 00:08:57,030
Gujarat border.
Yup.

133
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,165
Why?

134
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,117
Road Trip.

135
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:01,906
Don't blabber shit, Chitvan.

136
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:02,883
Where are we going?

137
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,207
Jodhpur.

138
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:05,946
To Chanchal's.

139
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:07,668
Chanchal's?

140
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:08,851
Yup.

141
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
Why?

142
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:11,914
Baba

143
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,098
But my life is fucked.

144
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,915
I can't take care of myself.
How will I manage you?

145
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,623
It's best that you stay with Chanchal.

146
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,356
But I don't want to go
to her place right now.

147
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,732
going to Manali to
meet mom and dad.

148
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,358
Why would I stay at my
sister's in-laws' place?

149
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,853
Why didn't you take
me to your place?

150
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:42,930
I did.

151
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:44,944
Things went south there.

152
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,884
You were drunk

153
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,106
I, somehow, put you
in the car and

154
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:54,361
Put you to sleep.

155
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,291
There was some disturbance

156
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,996
And I saw some people there for extortion

157
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,543
Loan sharks.

158
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,700
To collect last six months' EMIs

159
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:05,978
Will they take my car just
because some 5-6 checks bounced?

160
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,941
You should disappear.

161
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,222
Will have to leave Bombay.

162
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:15,587
Pakistan!

163
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,691
Maharashtra border, fool.

164
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:20,815
So I decided to take you to Chanchal.

165
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,113
So you're on the run?

166
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:31,876
You make it sound like I'm on
the run with someone else's car.

167
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:35,828
A little.

168
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,978
I'll pay the rest.

169
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,707
You got a lot of money?

170
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:42,929
Yeah, a lot.

171
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:45,159
Got it in divorce settlement.

172
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:49,349
She was culpable for the
affair so I got the money.

173
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,627
Oh, man.

174
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:52,945
You should have told me earlier.

175
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,303
I paid for your alcohol last night.

176
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:57,861
We're not discussing my problems here.

177
00:10:57,886 --> 00:11:00,886
We're trying to clear
the mess in your life.

178
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,263
Let's go to Bombay
and solve your problem.

179
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,930
I'll handle my issues
once I've dealt with you.

180
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:09,861
Don't worry about me, boss.

181
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:11,566
Alright.

182
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:13,972
We'll reach Baroda in 3 hours.
Take a flight from there.

183
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:18,589
Pass me the keys.
Why?

184
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:20,811
You're having herbs instead
of tea this early in

185
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,891
What are you doing in life?

186
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:48,478
What?

187
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,029
What's the plan?

188
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:57,512
Running away from your place
like a thief because of money

189
00:11:57,537 --> 00:12:00,084
Baba, don't ruin my high  by lecturing me.

190
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,600
Right.

191
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:03,343
Always stay high.

192
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,859
Live life from one moment to the next.

193
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:09,187
There's no focus, you don't
have any plans for your life

194
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,849
Baba, you had a plan, right?

195
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:17,911
Going well?

196
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:22,685
No, you're  right.

197
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,837
My plans failed.

198
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:25,906
My fucking marriage has failed

199
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:27,987
I'm jobless, homeless.

200
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:30,257
Thanks.

201
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:36,568
There's a plan

202
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,053
Breakfast.

203
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:43,654
There's a mind blowing place
to eat a little ahead.

204
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:06,257
Excuse me.

205
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:11,018
Could you please tell me how far Bharuch
is by checking it on the internet?

206
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,703
Yeah, sure.

207
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:13,338
The connection is a little weak here.

208
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:16,111
Where are you going anyway?

209
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,462
Baroda.

210
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:17,597
That'll do too.

211
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,185
Doesn't it get

212
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,954
Hot in this suit?

213
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,335
Yeah, it gets hot but

214
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,806
I'm habitual now.

215
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,246
Do you have any
other bad habits?

216
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:37,812
You should ask someone
inside about Bharuch

217
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:38,970
That'd be better.

218
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:40,959
At the reception...

219
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:54,892
What was that?

220
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,068
She was hitting on you.

221
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:58,665
Exactly but why?

222
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:00,748
Why so modest?

223
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:02,798
You're beautiful, Baba.

224
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:06,312
And women can smell broken marriages
and money quicker than a dog.

225
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,193
Let's go?

226
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:15,281
No, due to all this...

227
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,359
Dad was asking.

228
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,509
You told Dad?

229
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:21,911
Yeah, had to discuss plans for Jodhpur.

230
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,096
You told them about Jodhpur too?

231
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,183
I couldn't take such a big decision alone.

232
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,541
Texted Chanchal too.

233
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:28,736
Come on, man.

234
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,593
You should have told me once.

235
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:34,204
Now she'll feel bad if we don't go.

236
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:37,021
No one's gonna feel bad.

237
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:39,091
Everyone is busy in their lives.

238
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,257
Call Chanchal up.

239
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,806
Greetings, sir.

240
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:59,478
Yes, sir. Sure, sir.

241
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,906
Chanchal's gonna be a mother.

242
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:17,209
Chanchal's pregnant?

243
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,747
Means I'm gonna become a Chacha(uncle)

244
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:21,287
Chacha? It's your
sister's child.

245
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:27,281
Fuck man!

246
00:15:28,785 --> 00:15:30,718
Chacha sounds so much better.

247
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:33,254
You took this from me too!

248
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:38,727
Chachu...Chachu...

249
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:40,053
Fuck you.

250
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,622
I think we should go to Jodhpur.

251
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:45,660
I've been saying
that for so long.

252
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:58,075
I always wanted to be like my dad.

253
00:15:58,701 --> 00:15:59,788
But

254
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:02,680
Life has today made me a Maama.

255
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:08,824
Used to plan everything.

256
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:10,656
Sleeping on time,

257
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:11,935
Waking up on time,

258
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:13,779
Eating on time.

259
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:18,528
He used to decide Sunday's food on Friday.

260
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:21,278
I also did the same.

261
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:26,690
But the one thing my dad wouldn't plan

262
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,924
Were his road trips.

263
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:34,141
Every year, we used to go on
road trips for family holidays.

264
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,728
Always unplanned.

265
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:41,519
Just took the luggage and left.

266
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:46,716
Kashmir some time,

267
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:47,923
Some time Sikkim

268
00:16:47,947 --> 00:16:48,923
Or Kerala

269
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:49,955
Or Rajasthan.

270
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:55,117
Chitvan...

271
00:16:55,142 --> 00:16:57,679
Is like Dad on road trips.

272
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:01,098
Whom I could never understand.

273
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,481
Even you don't know!

274
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:14,207
That's a surprise.

275
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:16,739
Yeah, I'll call you once
I know the entire thing.

276
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,660
Okay, bye.

277
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,714
Dad also doesn't know.

278
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:25,996
Might not have told everyone
because of it being too soon.

279
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:29,681
There's a party for pregnancy,

280
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:33,882
Let's go.

281
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:40,986
Chanchal turned to be really smart.

282
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:42,959
Her life is set.

283
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:59,083
I don't understand the
need to do all this.

284
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:01,747
Is it necessary to celebrate
every other thing?

285
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:07,126
Bhabhi, these are delicate matters.
It's difficult to say anything.

286
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:10,271
You never know...

287
00:18:12,278 --> 00:18:13,271
Chandan!

288
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:14,512
Chanchal.

289
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:15,765
Chitvan.

290
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:16,845
Elephant.

291
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:25,501
You look shocked. But didn't
he send you a message?

292
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:26,755
Earlier today

293
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,847
On which number?

294
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:29,482
9872534...

295
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,254
Chitvan,

296
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,679
That's not my number.

297
00:18:34,674 --> 00:18:38,331
Sent it to Chanchal Chabra again.
Fuck.

298
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:40,955
You didn't tell that you were pregnant?

299
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:42,546
How do you know?

300
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:44,086
Why are you here?

301
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,895
Baba was taking a break
after his divorce.

302
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:46,988
Came to my club
while I was peeing...

303
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:49,124
You never told me that
you had a divorce.

304
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:51,682
I didn't know about
the marriage too.

305
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,961
What? Told you while we were peeing...

306
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:57,509
Bhabhi, you go ahead.

307
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,541
I'll be there in a couple of minutes.

308
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,193
Namaste.

309
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:08,061
You didn't even tell mom and dad?
No no no...

310
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:10,836
Oh.

311
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:12,288
What?

312
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:13,495
Chitvan.

313
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:14,256
Chitvan.

314
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:15,273
Camel!

315
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:27,169
About my divorce, your pregnancy

316
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:28,718
He can't keep anything in his stomach.

317
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:31,060
Baba, communication is really important.

318
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:33,243
Don't you see how
dysfunctional have we become?

319
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:35,149
No no no no...
Fuck!

320
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,777
There's a problem!

321
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,334
What happened?

322
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,731
I'm not actually pregnant.

323
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,209
What the fuck?

324
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,510
What is all this? These flowers?
All this decoration?

325
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:45,954
I just said it

326
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:48,161
Make these people quiet.
It was a small lie.

327
00:19:48,193 --> 00:19:50,260
Pranav went and told everybody.

328
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:51,724
Now, what?
